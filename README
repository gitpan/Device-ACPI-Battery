Device-ACPI-Battery
====================================

ABOUT

This module is used to collect information about batteries managed with ACPI by scraping the files found under 
/proc/acpi/battery/. Useful for tasks such as displaying battery status in terminal (what I use it for).

PREREQUISITES

Proper use of this module requires that your kernel has ACPI installed and is used to manage your battery, so please check your list of installed kernel modules (/proc/modules, look for 'battery') before attempting to use. An easy way to find out is by checking if /proc/acpi/battery exists and if it has any subdirectories similar to the default path specified above. If so, set $self->path to that full path.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
